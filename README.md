# Python-Graphic-Project
This is a python graphic generator I made for my course work, what it does is generate a python graphic based on the input of the user
 For example if the user says they want blue, green and red colours then the graphics will generate this size
 
This was my first project so the code isn't the best quality. I only used the John Zelle's graphic library
